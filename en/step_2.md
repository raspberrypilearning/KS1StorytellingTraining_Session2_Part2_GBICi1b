## Task 3: Drawing ideas
In this task, you will undertake [Unit 2 – Digital storytelling – Lesson 5 – Drawing ideas](http://ncce.io/l8sQ03). For this task, you will use the three resources in Lesson 5, Unit 2 folder. They include: the teacher-facing [lesson plan](http://ncce.io/6CRfZV) and the [presentation slides](http://ncce.io/PDlCFh). (Note that the presentation slides label the activities in the top right-hand corner to help you navigate the lesson.) The third document that you will need is the [Labelled drawing template](http://ncce.io/98UccZ), of which you will need to print one copy.

This lesson focuses on ideas for interactive stories, enabling you to develop your own, very simple digital story. The lesson begins with story ideas using the template provided and then follows with identifying suitable blocks to achieve those ideas with a focus on sequence. 

Develop a section of your digital story idea (or the whole of your idea) into a program. Make sure that you save the project, as you will use the template and the digital story to demonstrate to the class when you teach Unit 2 – Lesson 5. You will also share your project with the GBIC team in Task 7.
