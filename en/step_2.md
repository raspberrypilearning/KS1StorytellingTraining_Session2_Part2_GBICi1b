## Task 1: Drawing ideas
In this task, you will undertake [Unit 2 – Digital storytelling – Lesson 5 – Drawing ideas](http://ncce.io/l8sQ03). Use the three lesson resources provided: the teacher-facing [lesson plan](http://ncce.io/6CRfZV), the [presentation slides](http://ncce.io/PDlCFh), and the [Labelled drawing template](http://ncce.io/98UccZ) (print one copy). (Note that the presentation slides label the activities in the top right-hand corner to help you navigate the lesson.) 

This lesson focuses on ideas for interactive stories, enabling you to develop your own, very simple digital story. The lesson begins with developing story ideas using the template provided, followed by identifying suitable blocks to achieve those ideas, with a focus on sequence. 

Develop a section of your digital story idea (or the whole of your idea) into a program. Make sure that you save the project, as you will use the template and the digital story to demonstrate to the class when you teach Unit 2 – Lesson 5. You will also share your project with the GBIC team in Task 5.
