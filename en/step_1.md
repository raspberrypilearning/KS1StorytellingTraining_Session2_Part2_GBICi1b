## Part 2: Investigation of KS1 Storytelling resources
Part 2 builds on your existing teaching skills developed in other subjects. You will explore two lessons in detail giving you the opportunity to develop a working understanding of the relationship between the Lesson Plans and the Presentation Slides as well as to experience the lessons from the pupils' perspective. You will begin to code in ScratchJr and develop an interactive animation. There are seven tasks in Part 2.

**Introduction to tasks**
In part two of this session, you will familiarise yourself with ScratchJr and deepen your understanding of ScratchJr and the resources by completing one more of the lessons that the pupils themselves undertake.
