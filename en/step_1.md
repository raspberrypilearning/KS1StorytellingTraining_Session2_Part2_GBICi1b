## Session 3: KS1 'Storytelling' training â€“ Investigating resources
This session, Session 3, will help you explore the intervention in more depth. You will explore two lessons in detail, giving you the opportunity to develop a working understanding of the correlation between the lesson plans and the presentation slides, and to experience the lessons from the pupils' perspective. You will continue to code in ScratchJr and develop an interactive animation. There are seven tasks in Session 3.

**Introduction to the tasks**
In the first part of the session, you will familiarise yourself further with ScratchJr and deepen your understanding of the resources by completing a second lesson that the pupils will undertake.
