## Session 3: KS1 'Storytelling' training â€“ Investigating resources
This session, Session 3, builds on your existing teaching skills developed in other subjects. You will explore two lessons in detail, giving you the opportunity to develop a working understanding of the relationship between the lesson plans and the presentation slides, and to experience the lessons from the pupils' perspective. You will begin to code in ScratchJr and develop an interactive animation. There are seven tasks in Session 3.

**Introduction to the tasks**
In this part of the session, you will familiarise yourself further with ScratchJr and deepen your understanding of the resources by completing a second lesson that the pupils will undertake.
