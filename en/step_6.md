## Task 7: Sharing projects
Briefly explore digital storytelling further in [Unit 2 – Digital storytelling – Lesson 6 – Let me tell you a story](http://ncce.io/AbMR3v). This lesson focuses on developing and showcasing digital stories to the class. For this task, simply ensure that you are familiar with the ways you are sharing pupils’ projects in class. It's useful to know how to share your pupils’, as your own, digital story with colleagues using email and AirDrop. Follow [Sharing Scratch Projects](https://www.scratchjr.org/learn/tips/share-projects) to find out how.

Please email an attachment of your Task 3 project including your name/school to the Gender Research team on [genderresearch@raspberrypi.org](mailto:genderresearch@raspberrypi.org).
